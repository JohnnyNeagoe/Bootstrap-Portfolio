      <p>Web Developer, Business Analyst, Founder</p>
      <p>Certified Full Stack Developer - The University of Toronto.</p>
      <p>Honors Bachelor of Business Administration - Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In pursuit of my HBBA, I was able to attain valuable skills such as relationship development, business development, strategic analysis and product/service management. I will forever cherish my four year journey at WLU, as it has propelled me into becoming an ambitious, courageous and calculated individual who understands the importance of creating long sustainable relationships in the pursuit of dynamic business expansion. While at U of T, I mastered the art of front-end and back-end web design, and was granted the ability to build fully functioning websites and applications for companies in any industry.</p>
      <p>I have many years of accounting and finance work experience under my belt, allowing me to understand the importance of implementing a sustainable strategic direction to a business. During my various employment positions, I was able to identify one key metric that proved critical to healthy business growth: Strategic Cost Analysis. More importantly, the ability to procure the biggest possible margin on investments when considering overall brand development.</p>
      <p>Many businesses pay a substantial premium to receive web/app development support. In choosing my expertise for all of your website and application needs, you will be able to effectively develop your online brand using the newest forms of software and techniques at an industry leading low price.</p>
      <p>Let others see your company the way you see it and they will believe in it as much as you do.</p>
